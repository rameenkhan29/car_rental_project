# car_rental_project
This web-based car rental project is designed to streamline the process of booking and renting cars through a user-friendly online platform. It allows customers to browse available vehicles, check rental rates, view car details, and make reservations in real-time. The system provides features for user registration, secure login, booking history, and payment integration to ensure a smooth and efficient rental experience. Admins can manage car listings, track bookings, update availability, and generate reports. This project not only enhances customer convenience but also improves operational efficiency for rental companies by automating key tasks and reducing manual effort.
